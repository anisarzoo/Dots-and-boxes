# Image Assets

Place background and decoration images here:

- `greenboard-texture.jpg` - Optional chalkboard texture background
- `whiteboard-texture.jpg` - Optional whiteboard texture background
- `paper-texture.jpg` - Optional paper texture for UI elements
- `confetti.png` - Optional confetti sprites for celebrations

All images should be optimized for web (compressed JPG/PNG) and work well as CSS backgrounds.

The current design uses CSS gradients and colors, but you can enhance it with texture images for more realism.
