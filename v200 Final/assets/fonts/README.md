# Font Assets

Place custom fonts here if needed:

- `chalk-font.woff2` - Custom chalk-style handwriting font
- `marker-font.woff2` - Custom marker-style handwriting font

The project currently uses Google Fonts:
- Patrick Hand (for whiteboard theme)
- Schoolbell (alternative handwriting font)

If you want to use custom fonts for better offline support, place them here and update the CSS imports in theme.css.
